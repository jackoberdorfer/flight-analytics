This project is an in-depth analysis of airline passenger satisfaction, exploring how various factors such as delays, in-flight Wi-Fi service, ease of online booking, and type of travel affect passenger experience. Using a dataset that includes customer feedback on different flight attributes, the project visualizes key trends and relationships that can help airlines understand and improve customer satisfaction. The analysis focuses on identifying the impact of departure and arrival delays, the availability of in-flight Wi-Fi, and the ease of online booking, while examining differences in satisfaction between business and personal travelers.

To run the project, you will need to have Python installed along with key data analysis libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The analysis includes several visualizations such as count plots, bar plots, and heatmaps to interpret the data. Running the code is straightforward: after loading the dataset, you can execute each code cell in sequence to generate the corresponding visualizations and results. The major steps include loading the dataset, filtering and grouping the data, creating visual plots, and interpreting the results. Each section of the code focuses on a specific factor, such as delays or Wi-Fi service, and generates insights based on the observed trends.

The primary tools used in this project are Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn for creating statistical visualizations, and Matplotlib for plotting. Pandas is utilized to filter and group the dataset for specific analyses, such as calculating the number of passengers reporting no in-flight Wi-Fi. Seaborn provides the count plots, bar plots, and heatmaps that visually depict the relationships between different variables like satisfaction and delays. Matplotlib supports these visualizations by providing detailed control over the layout and formatting of the plots. These tools work together to transform the raw data into meaningful insights, allowing for a clear presentation of how various factors influence passenger satisfaction.
